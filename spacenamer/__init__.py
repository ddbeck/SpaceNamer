"""A module for generating names for spacecraft, instruments, and equipment in
the style of NASA. In other words, a backronym generator.

Lots of NASA equipment is named in a way that implies the acronym was
determined in reverse. For example, the treadmill aboard the International
Space Station is named "COLBERT" for comedian Stephen Colbert. COLBERT was then
used as the basis for the acronym phrase "Combined Operational Load Bearing
External Resistance Treadmill." Other examples include MESSENGER (MErcury
Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) and MAVEN (Mars
Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution).

This module attempts to generate acronyms similarly, by choosing an existing
word and coming up with a phrase based on it.
